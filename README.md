# Text-Based Calculator in Google Colab  

This project walks through building a simple text-based calculator in Python using Google Colab.
It’s designed for beginners who want to practice Python basics such as variables, input/output, conditionals, and loops.

## Features 

- Perform basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Choose the operation using a text menu  
- Handle division by zero safely  
- Keep running until the user decides to quit 

## Steps Covered

1. **Set up Google Colab** → Create and rename a new notebook  
2. **Start small** → Try basic math with variables (`a = 10, b = 5`)  
3. **Add user input** → Let the user type numbers and see results  
4. **Add operation choice** → Select from a menu of operations  
5. **Repeat until quit** → Use a loop so the calculator runs continuously
   
## How to Run  

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
2. Create a new notebook (**File → New Notebook**)  
3. As a beginner, it’s best to **type the code yourself** to gain practice,  
   but you can also copy and paste the code from each step into cells.  
4. Run each cell by clicking the **Run ▶️ button** (or use **Shift + Enter**).  
5. When the program asks for input (e.g., "Enter first number:"), type your number and press **Enter**.  

## Learning Goals  

By completing this project, you will:  
- Understand how Python handles arithmetic  
- Practice using `input()` and `print()`  
- Learn to use `if / elif / else` for decision making  
- Use `while True` loops to repeat programs until quit

By the end, you’ll have a fully working text-based calculator built step by step.
